Google Voice API + Robot + CNN Object Tracking

Repository created for convenience of FABlab Namibia team for Larry 2.0 (very much WIP). Instructions with links coming soon.

For Raspberry Pi script, requires TensorFlow, Raspberry Pi Voice Hat, and Pi Camera module. pc_tracker script runs fine with only a webcam but does not include voice API.
